# Newsmonk

NewsMonk is a real-time news aggregator web application developed by me. The app fetches up-to-the-minute headlines via a News API and organizes articles into categories (Business, Technology, Sports, etc.), enabling intuitive browsing and keyword search. It features a clean, responsive interface with smooth navigation and pagination for older content, plus a newsletter signup for daily updates. NewsMonk was built with React (using functional components and Hooks) and deployed on Vercel, integrating modern UI libraries like Tailwind CSS for styling. The site uses client-side routing for seamless category navigation and is optimized for fast load times on all devices. This personal project underscores my initiative and full-stack expertise in designing and delivering a polished, data-driven user experience from concept through deployment.
